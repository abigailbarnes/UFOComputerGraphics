# UFOComputerGraphics
This project is for my computer graphics class final capstone!

This project was completed in Python for my Computer Graphics course. I developed a 10-second animation of a cow getting abducted by a UFO. The cow and UFO meshes were both provided and downloaded respectively. I used Blender for object mesh positioning. I used B-splines to interpolate the camera, object, and light source position and edge flipping for my mesh manipulation. This project incorporated Python, NumPy, Pillow, Blender, and ImageIO

I placed top five in my computer graphics class for this animation, and itâ€™s getting to my head : ) lol

I coded in python for this! Please enjoy my silly little cow animation (abigailbarnes_animation.mp4)
