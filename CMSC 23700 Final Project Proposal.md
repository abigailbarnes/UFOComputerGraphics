# CMSC 23700 Final Project Proposal
I want to design the corner of a room with a window in it where the lighting (sun) changes position during the course of the video. Ideally, I would also like to include different pieces of art that appear on the wall (time permitting... I think this might be harder to impliment than I think it is). I chatted with Isaac a bit about my idea, but it seems like this might be heafty to accomplish given my lack of experience with Blender. I also found a free .obj file of a city (https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/uvw-polygons-unity-3d-model-1294342) that I would still like to try to modify and use the changing position of the light source idea. In my animation, I would like to impliment either Loop Subdivision [1 point], Bump Map [1.5 points], Cotangent Laplacian Smoothing [0.5 points] or some combonation of the points.
